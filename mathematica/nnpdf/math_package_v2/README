List and description of functions implemented in the NNPDF.m package

1) InitializePDFGrid[path, namegrid]
This function reads the PDF grid into memory specified by namegrid
(both unpolarized or polarized) from the location specified by path. 
It also performs the PDF interpolation in 
the (x-Q2) space by means of built-in Mathematica interpolation 
algorithm.

2) alphas[Q2,ipo,imodev]
This function returns the QCD strong coupling constant alpha_s. 
Its inputs are:
- Q2    : the energy scale, in GeV^2, at which alpha_s is computed;
- ipo   : the perturabtive order at which alpha_s is computed 
          (0: LO; 1: NLO; 2: NNLO);
- imodev: the evolution mode with which alpha_s is computes 
          (0: alpha_s is computed as a function of alpha_s at the Z 
           mass reference scale as given in the .LHgrid file; 
           1: exact solution of the QCD beta function equation using 
           Runge-Kutta algorithm).

3) xPDFcv[x,Q2,f]
This function returns x times the central value of the PDF with flavor  
f at a given momentum fraction x and scale Q2 (in GeV^2).  Note that f 
must be an integer, and x and QSq must be numeric quantities. For the 
unpolarized case, the LHAPDF convention is used for the flavor f, that is, 
f = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponds to tbar, bbar, 
cbar, sbar, ubar, dbar, g, d, u, s, c, b, t; f=7 returns the photon PDF 
(if available). Only for NNPDFpol1.0, the following convention is used for 
the flavor f, that is, f = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to polarized g, u+ubar, 
d+dbar, s+sbar.

4) xPDFEnsemble[x,Q2,f]
This function returns x times the vector of PDF replicas of flavor f at 
a given momentum fraction x and scale Q2 (in GeV^2). Note that f 
must be an integer, and x and QSq must be numeric quantities. For the 
unpolarized case, the LHAPDF convention is used for the flavor f, that is, 
f = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponds to tbar, bbar, 
cbar, sbar, ubar, dbar, g, d, u, s, c, b, t; f=7 returns the photon PDF 
(if available). Only for NNPDFpol1.0, the following convention is used for 
the flavor f, that is, f = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to polarized g, u+ubar, 
d+dbar, s+sbar.

5) xPDFRep[x,Q2,f,irep]
This function returns x times the irep PDF replica of flavor f at a 
given momentum fraction x and scale Q2 (in GeV^2). Note that f must be an 
integer, and x and Q2 must be numeric quantities. The LHAPDF convention 
is used for the flavor f, that is, 
f = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
corresponds to tbar, bbar, cbar, sbar, ubar, dbar, g, d, u, s, c, b, t.

6) xPDF[x,Q2,f]
This function returns x times the value of the PDF of flavor f at a 
given momentum fraction x and scale Q2 (in GeV^2) with its standard 
deviation. Note that f 
must be an integer, and x and QSq must be numeric quantities. For the 
unpolarized case, the LHAPDF convention is used for the flavor f, that is, 
f = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponds to tbar, bbar, 
cbar, sbar, ubar, dbar, g, d, u, s, c, b, t; f=7 returns the photon PDF 
(if available). Only for NNPDFpol1.0, the following convention is used for 
the flavor f, that is, f = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to polarized g, u+ubar, 
d+dbar, s+sbar.

7) xPDFCL[ensemble,x,Q2,f,CL]
This function returns x times the value of the PDF of flavor f at a 
given momentum fraction x and scale Q2 (in GeV^2) with its standard 
deviation. Note that f 
must be an integer, and x and QSq must be numeric quantities. For the 
unpolarized case, the LHAPDF convention is used for the flavor f, that is, 
f = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponds to tbar, bbar, 
cbar, sbar, ubar, dbar, g, d, u, s, c, b, t; f=7 returns the photon PDF 
(if available). Only for NNPDFpol1.0, the following convention is used for 
the flavor f, that is, f = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to polarized g, u+ubar, 
d+dbar, s+sbar.
The variable ensemble 
is the PDF ensemble, as a function of x, Q2 and f. It can be given by 
the function xPDFEnsemble (LHAPDF basis) or by any PDF ensemble (in a 
different basis) defined by the user. The variable CL denotes the 
confidence interval and must be a real number between 0 and 1.

8) alphaSMZ[]

in the QCD analysis for each replica.

20) Q2Max[]
This function returns the maximum value of the Q2-grid.

21) ForcepolPDFtoLHAPDF[]
Polarized PDFs are given in the flavor basis, with quark antiquark 
flavors not disentangled. This function allows to separate the quark 
and antiquark contributions using dummy assumptions.

22) UnForcepolPDFtoLHAPDF[]
Polarized PDFs are correctly resetted to use only quark and antiquark 
combinations.

23) HasPhoton[]
Returns information about the availability of the photon PDF in the
initialized grid.
